    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First) algorithm selects the process with the smallest remaining burst time from the ready queue for execution. It is a preemptive scheduling algorithm.</p>
    <p>Processes are scheduled based on their remaining burst times, where the process with the smallest remaining time is given priority. If a new process arrives with a shorter burst time than the currently running process, the currently running process is preempted and the new process is executed.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>At time 0, only Process P1 is available in the ready queue.</li>
          <li>At time 1, Process P2 arrives.</li>
          <li>At time 6, Process P3 arrives.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Process Execution:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Process P1 starts execution at time 0 and runs until time 1.</li>
          <li>At time 1, Process P2 arrives and runs until 2, now P2 and P3 have same burst time. As P2 is already executing, it will continue its execution till 6 and completes its task.</li>
          <li>At time 6, Process P3 arrives with a shortest burst time and runs till 10 and completed its job.</li>
          <li>Now the left over process if P1, it will execute for its remaining time and run till 18 and completes its job.</li>

        <ul>

          <li>Waiting Time of P2 = 6 - 2 = 4</li>
